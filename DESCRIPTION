Title: MCMC inference of durations and flows from UK hospital data
Version: 1.5.0

Description: MCMC package for preliminary fits of hospital progression parameters
    (transition probabilities and durations in each state). The outputs of these fits
    are passed up to the larger mechanistic model as priors or relative risks for a
    further level of fitting. NB, this package is essentially a re-purpose of the drjacoby
    package, and still contains some legacy code.
